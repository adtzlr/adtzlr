Hi there 🖐️,

this is Andreas, a mechanical engineer graduated from Graz University of Technology, based in [🏰⛰️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlossberg_(Graz)) Graz, Austria 🇦🇹. In my free time, I like running 🏃‍, skiing ⛷️ and snowboarding 🏂 while I also enjoy family times at home 👨‍👩‍👧.

Currently, I'm a full-time engineer in the 🚂 railway industry (during the day) and a PhD student at Graz University of Technology at the Institute of Structural Durability and Railway Technology (well, at night... 📚 🕯️). All the tools related to my scientific work are available here on my GitHub profile.

I'm the author of 🔍 FElupe, an open-source finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Most of the open source finite element packages I found are either super-difficult to install, needs to be compiled or are great but slow (or at least too slow for my needs).

> With FElupe, I try to fill a gap in between.

I'm convinced that static input files 🖨️ which are passed to a standalone fea solver 🖩 are a thing of the last decades 💾. Instead, scripts **are** input files: easy to adopt scripts with access to third-party libraries 🛒, written in common scripting languages are the way to go. With **common languages** I mean something easy-to-learn for engineers, like Python, Matlab/Octave or Julia, not another proprietary simulation file format. FElupe is just another one of many open-source finite element analysis packages using this approach.
