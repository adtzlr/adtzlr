Hi there 🖐️,

this is Andreas, a mechanical engineer graduated from Graz University of Technology, based in [🏰⛰️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlossberg_(Graz)) Graz, Austria. In my free time, I like running 🏃‍, skiing ⛷️ and snowboarding 🏂 while I also enjoy family times at home 👨‍👩‍👧.

Currently, I'm a full-time engineer in the 🚂 railway industry (during the day) and a PhD student at Graz University of Technology at the Institute of Structural Durability and Railway Technology (well, at night... 📚 🕯️). All the tools related to my scientific work are available here on my GitHub repository.

I'm the author of FElupe, an open-source finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Most of the open source finite element packages I found are either super-difficult to install, needs to be compiled or are great but slow (or at least too slow for my needs). 

> With FElupe, I tried to fill a gap in between.
